## 🚀 Overview

**JobMatch** is a fully hosted, modern full-stack job-matching platform that helps companies find talent and job seekers discover opportunities.

Job seekers can create a profile, browse vacancies, and apply to jobs. Companies can post vacancies, review applicants, and manage applications. Once an application is accepted, both parties can communicate directly through a built-in messaging system.

The platform is built using a Next.js frontend and a NestJS backend, with a PostgreSQL database managed through Prisma.

## 🙌 Final Notes

I built JobMatch because I wanted to create something that feels like a real product — not just another school-style project. Along the way, I pushed myself to handle everything from role-based flows to messaging, deployment pipelines, and a more “production-like” architecture.

I made plenty of mistakes, refactored a lot, and learned even more about structuring full-stack applications in a way that’s maintainable and realistic. I’m proud of where the project is now, and even more motivated to keep improving it.

Thanks for taking the time to look through it — and if you have feedback or ideas, I’d genuinely love to hear them.
